1)	How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
a)	Learning your audience's background allows you to know how far or how deep into an explanation you can go when explaining a concept to them. For example, when telling your audience about something new, the experts require only little explanation, while the regular folks require simpler approaches that will simplify the topic for them.
2)	What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
a)	Know your audience by conducting surveys and using the demographic data to build up on your knowledge.
b)	Divide the content into different level segments tailored to the different groups in the audience.
c)	Use audience-specific examples to create a connection between the speaker and the audience.
d)	Match the tone and language to avoid oversimplification or overcomplication when talking to your audience.
e)	Be open to receiving feedback from your audience that can be used to refine your content.
3)	How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
a)	Use surveys and polls to familiarize yourself with the knowledge your audience has and what you can build on, and what needs to be done from the beginning.
b)	Give out feedback forms to know just what the audience has learned and what you need to explain better.
4)	What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
a)	Concepts should be simple and in an easy-to-understand form with no unfamiliar terms.
b)	Incorporate visual aids into the presentation, like graphs and charts.
c)	Add real-world examples and common analogies for familiarity.

c)	It reduces frustrations between the groups of people involved and fosters better communication.
6)	Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?
